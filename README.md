# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

In this challenge, we wrote a code for Python that would allow us to get the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout to give the election commission a well-rounded overview of the election.

## Election-Audit Results

o	369,711 votes were cast in this congressional election.

o	The county breakdown is Jefferson County with 38,855 votes or 10.5% of the total county votes, Denver County with 306,055 votes or 82.8% of the total county votes, and Arapahoe County 24,801 votes or 6.7% of the total county votes

o	Denver County had by far the largest turnout.

o	The candidate breakdown is Charles Casper Stockholm with 85,213 votes and 23% of the total votes, Diane DeGette with 272,892 votes and 73.8% of the total votes, and Raymon Anthony Doane with 11,606 votes and 3.1% of the total votes.

o	Diane DeGette won the election 272,892 votes and 73.8% of the total votes.


## Election-Audit Summary

This code could be easily modified to process other election results.  The easiest modification for be for another similar congressional election.  In that situation, the only modification would be to import a different dataset.  
Other modifications within the code would be for statewide or city elections, and in those cases the modifications would be to the different lists and dictionaries.  The code could be modified for many different datasets that have to deal with voting.  It could modified for homecoming king race by changing the counties to grade levels.
